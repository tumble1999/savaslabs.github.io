Anne received a B.S. in textile engineering and worked in the clinical research industry for five years before becoming a web developer. At Savas, Anne focuses on Drupal theming, translating designs to code, and enhancing user experience. She is particularly interested in Sass, CSS3, and Object-Oriented CSS. When her laptop is closed, Anne enjoys cooking, playing old Zelda games, and all things musical. She plays piano (and occasionally ukulele) in local bands My Brother, My Sister and Jon Sebastian and the Tresspassers, who had a <a href="http://jonsebastian.bandcamp.com/track/nightmare-sisters">song</a> featured on NPR Music's Favorite Songs of 2014.
