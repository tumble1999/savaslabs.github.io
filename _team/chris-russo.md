Chris has been a professional web developer since 2007 and made his first website on geocities.com when he was 11. He was a big fan of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blink"><code>&lt;blink&gt;&lt;/blink&gt;</code></a> and was deeply saddened when it became a deprecated element. For Savas, Chris most enjoys providing bespoke solutions for clients, and writing in the third person. When Chris is not behind the computer, he’s probably doing something related to a bicycle. He is the Board President of nonprofit hospitality network [WarmShowers.org](https://www.warmshowers.org), serves on the board of his local bicycle advocacy organization [Bike Durham](http://www.bikedurham.org), founded a bicycle-powered food scraps recycling company called [Tilthy Rich Compost](http://www.tilthyrich.com), and rode his bicycle 6,000 miles across the U.S. in the summer of 2008.
