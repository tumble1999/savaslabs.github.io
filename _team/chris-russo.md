Chris has been a professional web developer since 2007 and made his first website
on geocities.com when he was 11. He was a big fan of 
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blink"><code>&lt;blink&gt;&lt;/blink&gt;</code></a> 
and was deeply saddened when it was deprecated. For Savas Labs, Chris relishes in
the success and growth of his clients and team, and writing in the third 
person. When Chris is not behind the computer, he’s often on a bicycle. He is 
the former board chair of nonprofit hospitality network 
[WarmShowers.org](https://www.warmshowers.org), served on the board of his 
local bicycle advocacy organization [Bike Durham](http://www.bikedurham.org) for
3.5 years, founded a bicycle-powered food scraps recycling company called 
[Tilthy Rich Compost](http://www.tilthyrichcompost.com), and rode his bicycle 
6,000 miles across the U.S. in the summer of 2008.
