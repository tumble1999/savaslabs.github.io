  The user revision module does not (_yet_) care about `drush sqlsan`, 
  and it should!

  One of the most embarrassing and potentially costly things we can do as developers
  is to send emails out to real people unintentionally from a development 
  environment. It happens, and often times we aren't even aware of it until the damage
  is done and a background process sends out, say, 11,000 automated emails to
  existing customers (actually happened to a former employer recently). In the 
  Drupal world, there are <a href="https://github.com/chrisarusso/Tilthy-Rich-Compost-Website/commit/64a558e2">myriad ways</a>
  to <a href="https://github.com/chrisarusso/Tilthy-Rich-Compost-Website/blob/master/scripts/sanitize.php">attempt to address</a> this problem. 
  
  We discuss how to use a drush hook on the `drush sqlsan` command to ensure 
  proper sanitization while using the `user revision` module.

#### The general problem
One of the most embarrassing and potentially costly things we can do as developers
is to send emails out to real people unintentionally from a development 
environment. It happens, and often times we aren't even aware of it until the damage
is done and a background process sends out, say, 11,000 automated emails to
existing customers (actually happened to a former employer recently). In the 
Drupal world, there are [myriad ways](https://github.com/chrisarusso/Tilthy-Rich-Compost-Website/commit/64a558e2)
to [attempt to address](https://github.com/chrisarusso/Tilthy-Rich-Compost-Website/blob/master/scripts/sanitize.php) this problem. 
    
#### General solutions to the general problem
- [maillog](https://www.drupal.org/project/maillog) - A Drupal module that 
logs mails to the database and optionally allows you to "not send" them
- [reroute email](https://www.drupal.org/project/reroute_email) - A Drupal
module that intercepts email and routes it to a configurable address 
- [devel mail](https://api.drupal.org/api/devel/devel.mail.inc/7) - An 
option of the beloved devel module which writes emails to local files instead 
of sending
- [mailcatcher](http://mailcatcher.me/) (not Drupal-specific) - Configure your 
local mail server to not send mail through PHP

#### The _ultimate_ solution to _the problem_?
**Never store real email addresses in your development environment**. In the 
Drupal world, we do that by using the `drush sql-sanitize` 
[command](http://drushcommands.com/drush-6x/sql/sql-sanitize). With no arguments,
how I typically execute it, the command will set all users emails addresses to 
a phony address that looks like this: `user+1@localhost.localdomain`. This is a 
good thing. Then, even in cases in which you do accidentally send out emails 
in an automated way, often from [cron](https://www.drupal.org/cron), sending to phony addresses
is a livable mistake; no end-user receives an email that confuses
her or makes her lose confidence in your organization.
  
So, in _most_ cases, `drush sqlsan` (alias) is enough, and the mail redirection
options linked above are additional safety measures. Of course, I'm not
writing about _most_ scenarios now am I? Sadly, I'm not yet aware of a 
comprehensive solution that ensures no email will be sent from a development 
environment. Please [comment](#js-expander-trigger) if you know of one!
  
#### The _specific_ problem with `user_revision` module
One pernicious case, in which `drush sqlsan` is insufficient in sanitizing your 
database, is when  the 
[`user_revision` module](https://www.drupal.org/project/user_revision)
is enabled on a Drupal 7 site, at least without 
[my patch](https://www.drupal.org/node/2534638) 
applied. The `user_revision` module 
[extends the `UserController`](http://cgit.drupalcode.org/user_revision/tree/user_revision.module?id=cce42174aec453e6652da8738e397df20b6f2cd0#n164) 
class, which overwrites fields from the "base" table `users` (in the case) to 
the "revision" table, `user_revision`, due to
[the way that `entity_load()` works](http://cgit.drupalcode.org/drupal/tree/includes/entity.inc?h=7.x#n306) 
. Therefore, when a user entity is loaded, it receives the `mail` field 
from the `user_revision` table. Without the above patch applied, 
this table is not affected by `drush sqlsan`.


#### How did I discover this?
I discovered this when adding new cron, notification functionality to the 
[Tilthy Rich Compost](http://tilthyrichcompost.com) website, which we maintain. 
We [began using](https://github.com/chrisarusso/Tilthy-Rich-Compost-Website/commit/fccc3f7387616510d512d3700639c5de3a560a1e) the `user_revision` 
module in 2013 due to [losing information we still needed](https://github.com/chrisarusso/Tilthy-Rich-Compost-Website/issues/29
) from canceling users. After sending emails to subscribers from my development
environment for the 10th time in 2 years, even after sanitizing, I was determined 
to figure out once and for all, what was going on. So like any deep-dive, I 
fired up the trusty ol' debugger and discovered the aforementioned culprit. 

#### The solution to the _specific_ problem
After consulting [Kosta](/team/kosta-harlan/), we agreed 
that the solution would be to write a [drush hook](https://www.drupal.org/node/2534638) 
for the `user_revision` module. This code would need to sanitize the `mail` 
field in the `user_revision` table and would be invoked when the `drush sqlsan` 
command is executed in the presence of the `user_revision` module.  However, 
to write this code efficiently and effectively, I would need to debug drush commands
during execution, which I had never done.

#### How to debug drush (or other CLI scripts) with PHPStorm  
    
##### Set up xdebug (Mac only)    
I first installed xdebug with [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) via 
[this method](http://antistatique.net/en/we/blog/2013/09/17/debugging-with-xdebug-and-phpstorm-on-macos-x).
NB: Changing the port change to `10000` was necessary for me.
   
##### Upgrade to latest drush
I [ensured I was using the most recent version of drush](http://whaaat.com/installing-drush-8-using-composer) 
(I strongly recommend perusing Brant's [about page](http://whaaat.com/about)) 
to ensure that the code I wrote would apply to most recent drush development.

##### Getting breakpoints in PHPStorm to listen to drush
Several have blogged about this before, so I'll just point theirs out. Generally,
I followed 
[these instructions](https://www.deeson.co.uk/labs/debugging-drupal-drush-real-time-phpstorm-and-xdebug),
but I trust that my mentor and friend 
Randy Fay['s article](http://randyfay.com/content/remote-command-line-debugging-phpstorm-phpdrupal-including-drush)
is excellent as well. They all seemed to use 
[xdebug](http://xdebug.org/) and [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/),
and though I use PHPStorm, I have been using ZendDebugger for years, with 
reasonable success. But I _had_ been dissatisfied of late, and the rest of the 
[team](/team) uses xdebug anyway, so I figured it would be a safe switch, 
which proved true. After having xdebug properly installed, you can 
[add a line](https://github.com/kostajh/dotfiles/blob/master/.bashrc#L85) 
to your `.bashrc` file to always make PHPStorm ready to listen for drush 
commands.

#### The solution in action
So [now when running `drush sqlsan`](https://github.com/chrisarusso/Tilthy-Rich-Compost-Website/commit/cf8f04f65b9f782ebaaf84d4348043f5aeec8409), 
we can truly feel safe that we won't send emails to anyone we didn't mean to.

#### Will `user_revision` exist in D8?
It's not clear, though [some](https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/devpreview/2444961)
think [so](https://www.drupal.org/node/2336681).
Perhaps mature D8 entities and revisioning on all entities will render a contrib 
module unnecessary. Time will tell.
