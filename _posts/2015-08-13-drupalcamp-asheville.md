### Drupalcamp Asheville, we're coming!
Savas will be represented at Drupalcamp Asheville this year! 
[Anne](/team/anne-tomasevich/), and 
[Chris](/team/chris-russo/)
are both presenting. Anne will present on Drupal 8 theming, roughly based off
her [blog post about it](/2015/06/10/d8-theming-basics.html), a topic with
very little reliable information out there in the wild, and Chris is presenting
on his "personal git workflow, for everyone", which is also based off a 
[blog post he wrote recently](/2015/07/09/personal-git-workflow.html).

We're excited to head to the beautiful Asheville to teach, share and learn. We
might even get a hike in and some craft beer while we're at it.
