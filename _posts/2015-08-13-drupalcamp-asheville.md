### Drupalcamp Asheville, we're coming!
Savas will be represented at [Drupalcamp Asheville](https://www.drupalasheville.com/camp/2015/program/schedule/sessions) this year! 
[Anne](/team/anne-tomasevich/) and [Chris](/team/chris-russo/)
are both presenting. Anne will present on Drupal 8 theming, roughly based off
her [blog post about it](/2015/06/10/d8-theming-basics.html), a topic with
very little reliable information out there in the wild, and Chris is presenting
on his "personal git workflow, for everyone," which is also based off a
[blog post he wrote recently](/2015/07/09/personal-git-workflow.html).

We're excited to head to beautiful Asheville to teach, share and learn. We
might even get a hike in and some craft beer while we're at it.
