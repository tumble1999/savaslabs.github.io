summary: The truth behind the palindrome.
---

Previously, on our [who we are](/team) page, I gave you a taste of the 
[meaning](/team#what-does-savas-mean) of Savas. Now let's take a deeper dive.

For those who know me, they _think_ I'm zany. For those who know me well, they
**know** I'm zany. For the select few who know me really well, and/or have worked 
with me, they know I have an odd obsession with 
[palindromes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome).

This is why, when we asked [Harbor](http://www.studioharbor.com) to help us
come up with a company identity, including designing our logo and our name, 
 "palindrome" was naturally a category... e pluribus unum

#### Really though?
While the original impetus for choosing a name that is a palindrome _did_ stem 
from previous wholesale high-regard for palindromes, I began to appreciate 
the **balance** and **symmetry** that they represent aesthetically, and therefore 
thematically for our company. 

> It fits really well. 

said I. 
"Savas" was actually a low-ranking option early on due to our initial, internal feelings on the 
connotation as it was presented to us, but after holding a focus group on 
top contenders, we discovered people found it alluring, and also tied it to 
"savant" and other words that made them think of knowledge from the French:
 _savoir_ . 
 

##### Fun palindromic facts
- Our area code in Durham, NC is a palindrome: 919
- One of the team's house numbers is a palindrome: not going to tell you who or what

- In writing this, I learned a *new* literary term: [Semordnilap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome#Semordnilaps) 
which is a word when read backward is a different word! E.g. repaid
- The world's longest palindromic phrase, at least so far _and_ according to [these guys](http://norvig.com/palindrome.html)
is 17,826 words!
