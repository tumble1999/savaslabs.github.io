After a long lull in activity, Savas Labs would like to reinvigorate the [TriDUG](https://groups.drupal.org/) evening meetups. We recognize there is a lot of Drupal need and experience here in the Triangle, and we want to collaborate more with our local community. With the help of Barb Baranski, we have sent out a questionnaire to the group to better understand interests, days and locations that will work for the group, and you have responded!

[We'll host the first session at our home base](http://www.meetup.com/triDUG/events/229414499/), the American Underground @ Main in downtown Durham.

We'll have pizza here at 6:30, and do some mingling until about 7:00. At 7:00 we'll do introductions, and share any pertinent information about projects we're working on, job opportunities, and the like.

At 7:15 or so, Kosta Harlan will present on all things Drupal 8. He has a couple of [real-world projects he's built](https://www.durhamatletico.com) or [helped build](https://github.com/savaslabs/durham-civil-rights-map) in Drupal 8, and will spend some time presenting on the specifics of those site builds. Plenty of time will be factored in for Q&A throughout the presentation with some additional time at the end.

We'll also discuss future locations, topics and times that work for other members of the group, so we strongly encourage you to come out to this session even if it's not ideal for you on an ongoing basis to help shape the future of the meetup that this community deserves.

We look forward to seeing you in Durham on St. Patrick's Day!
