## The long version

### Talk about importance of project/executing on time

### Migration

- Detail everything we migrated: so many nodes with refactored content types with tons of fields, very complex tags that were also refactored, tons of files
- Use numbers - maybe include a table?
- Mention that it was important to migrate basically 100% of content, all the way back to year 2000

### Feeds?

### Docker - development and deployment
