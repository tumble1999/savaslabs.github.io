project_description: |
  When Duke's flagship news site's upgrade from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 needed a new development team, Savas Labs came in to complete their full content migration, provide a polished content editing interface, and deliver complex custom code, all on a Docker platform.
project_objective: |
  During their project to upgrade the Duke Today website from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7, fellow Durham natives and design agency Cuberis parted ways with their initial development partner and were left with a half-built site and sixteen years' worth of nodes, files, and taxonomy terms to be migrated. Faced with a tight deadline, they contracted Savas Labs to set up and execute the complex content migration and implement custom functionality on the front end, in the content editing interface, and for various feeds used by Duke departments across the university. And, since Duke Today was to be served via Duke's in-house platform-as-a-service tool for running Dockerized Drupal sites, Savas Labs would need to Dockerize the site for both local development and deployment.

## The long version

### Talk about importance of project/executing on time

### Migration

- Detail everything we migrated: so many nodes with refactored content types with tons of fields, very complex tags that were also refactored, tons of files
- Use numbers - maybe include a table?
 - 23593 files
 - 100421 nodes (13 content types)
 - 115 taxonomy terms
- Mention that it was important to migrate basically 100% of content, all the way back to year 2000

### Feeds?

### Docker - development and deployment
