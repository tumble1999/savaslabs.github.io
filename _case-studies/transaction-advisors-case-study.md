client_quote: |
  When faced with a challenging multi-site build out that included importing content from a very old platform, creating 3 integrated subscription forms, and launching under a tight timeline, Savas was strategic, knowledgeable, and great to work with. They were the right team for our complex project!

project_description: |
  When Transaction Advisors acquired two related websites, Savas Labs helped integrate those sites into their existing Drupal 7 infrastructure, providing responsive theming, subscription access, and a single administrative interface for all three sites.
project_objective: |
  After Transaction Advisors acquired two related publications (SatelliteFinance and TelecomFinance), it was important that they be able to easily manage all three websites from a single administrative interface. For branding purposes, they wanted a similar look and feel across the three sites. Lastly, it was critical to offer users online subscription access to each site’s paywall protected content.
project_process: |
  Savas Labs integrated the two new sites with the existing Transaction Advisors Drupal 7 installation and database using the Drupal Domain Access module. This allowed each site to have its own domain name and theme while providing a single administrative interface for all three. We leveraged our previous experience theming Transaction Advisors to theme the new SatelliteFinance and TelecomFinance sites in a responsive way so that they worked on all devices. For easy subscription management and access to paywall restricted content we integrated [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) via a custom module. Lastly, we used the Drupal Feeds module to import all content from the two legacy sites before going live.
project_results: |
  Thanks to an agile approach in which we worked closely with our clients, the new sites launched in time for an important conference, the administrative burden from running three separate websites was reduced, and both customers and the business felt the benefit of easy to manage subscriptions.
