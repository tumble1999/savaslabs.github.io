project_description: |
  When, after nearly seven years, HPTN decided to update their website to a modern, mobile-friendly site that was relatively easy to maintain and support, they started evaluating the capabitites of various content management systems that would meet their needs.  They settled on Drupal 8.
project_objective: |
  After HPTN made the definitive decision to move forward with plans for a website redesign using Drupal 8 as the basis for the content driven application, their primary objectives were: to provide their site users with a clean, modern site that loads easily on mobile devices in areas of the world with less than optimal bandwidth, and to provide the content maintainers with low maintenance, user friendly site that is intuitive and easy to use when adding and maintaining content.
project_process: |
  We evaluated the needs of the site's target audiences to determine the best path forward with the site design.  Once the design was completed, we began implementing the functional components of the site using Drupal 8.  We heavily relied on Drupal content entities to house data coming from legacy systems that was to be displayed on the site, themed the site so that it would render properly on a variety of mobile devices in use by remote scientists and clinical workers around the world, and leveraged both Drupal and external caching mechanisms to ensure prompt delivery of requests to end users.
project_results: |
  Thanks to in integrated approach in which we worked closely with our client, the new site launched in time for the HPTN Annual Conference, the ongoing maintenance and administration of the content has decreased dramatically, and both the corporate site maintainers and the remote users reaped the benefits of an easily navigable, mobile-friendly delivery of data.
