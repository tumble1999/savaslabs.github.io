## Mission Statement

carefully to their needs, strategizing collaboratively and delivering 
first-class technical solutions.

## Core Values


#### Diversity

We embrace diversity in every sense of the word, not only for the benefits it
brings to the company by providing a more holistic perspective on problem solving,
but as it pertains to the empowerment of traditionally and presently
underrepresented groups. We strive to craft an intentionally inclusive work
environment in which everyone feels comfortable in her own skin.

#### Collaboration

Collaboration by means of listening, learning, and teaching is core to our 
spirit and key to our success. We share our knowledge and experience in our 
daily teamwork and enrich the broader community by imparting our expertise 
through [blog posts](/news/), [public code contributions](https://www.drupal.org/savas), 
[hosting local meetups](http://www.meetup.com/triDUG/), and giving talks at 
conferences.

#### Respect

Respect is paramount to fostering trust with each other and our partners. We 
recognize that we are all imperfect human beings and we approach problems with 
humility and understanding. With egos checked at the door, our professional 
ethos, founded in honesty and integrity, makes us a delight to collaborate with.

#### Balance

[Balance](/team/#what-does-savas-mean) is important to us at Savas. We work 
hard while we’re on the clock but appreciate and encourage aspirations outside 
of the work place. Having fun does not have to come at the cost of productivity, 
and we find just the opposite to be the case. We aspire to be well-rounded 
partners, citizens, and members of our communities.

#### Quality

We take great care to ensure the quality of the work we produce. By taking a 
client-centric approach to solving problems and constantly adding value we 
ensure we’re truly understanding each client’s needs and providing thoughtful, 
right-fit solutions by adhering to best practices. We hold ourselves to a high 
and constantly improving standard.
