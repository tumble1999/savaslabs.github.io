<p class="page-description">Savas is founded on years of Drupal and web development experience, focused on creating standards-compliant, sustainable code.</p>

### Drupal

<img src="/assets/icons/drupal.png" alt="druplicon" align="left" height="44px" width="44px">
[Our team](/team) has built dozens of Drupal sites. We understand the value of sustainable code and write Drupal coding standards compliant PHP, JavaScript, and CSS. We have a thorough knowledge of best practices for deploying small and large scale Drupal sites. We're skilled in all aspects of development, from back-end to large scale data migration, from theming to automated testing.

We provide professional Drupal training to clients in the Triangle area. Our standard curriculum covers Drupal module development, map making with Drupal, site building, and theming basics. We can also custom-tailor a class for your needs.

Our team has rescued poorly-built Drupal implementations and refactored legacy, bug-ridden code to be secure and reliable. We have also done security audits for clients, both to prevent hacks, and as part of a hack recovery process. (None of the sites we manage were compromised by [DrupalGeddon](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupalgeddon).)

Savas believes in giving back to the community. Several of our team members contribute patches and maintain modules on [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org), and in 2015 Savas will be organizing Drupal code sprints in Durham.

### Automated testing

<i class="fa fa-check-circle-o fa-2x fa-pull-left"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Testing. Every site needs it, but all too often in the industry this comes down to a time-consuming and tedious process of manually clicking through pages on the site.

The Savas team takes a different approach. We use automated tests in [Behat](http://behat.org), [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de), [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org) and others, and integrate them with [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org) and [Travis](http://travis-ci.org). We pride ourselves on delivering stable, secure, and tested code.

### Web Mapping

<i class="fa fa-globe fa-2x fa-pull-left"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;With an [expert cartographer](/team/tim-stallmann) on our team, Savas can help you tell powerful stories with data. Our team has a range of experience with mapping both using Drupal and in custom web applications, and with different mapping toolkits like [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com) and [OpenLayers](http://www.openlayers.org). Because of our wide range of experience, we're able to be platform-agnostic and work with you to help you discern what mapping frameworks will best suit your unique needs.
